	<h1>Matthew G. Robinson</h1>
	<h3>Web Development Portfolio</h3>
	<p>I am a public policy professional who also builds websites. I educated myself in web design and development so I could maintain a site for the US Department of Veterans Affairs, and in the process discovered a new interest. While I don't have the credentials of a professional web developer, I learn quickly and enjoy solving problems.</p>
	<p>The following are three examples of my past work...</p>

		<h2><a href="vaci-v3-1/index.html" target="_blank">VA Center for Innovation</a></h2>
		<p>One of my many responsibilities during my four-and-a-half-year tenure at the Department of Veterans Affairs was to maintain the public website for my program, the Center for Innovation. In addition to regularly updating the content, I developed a number of enhancements to the site's design and functionality.</p>
		<p>We went through three different builds while I was there, each of which was initially constructed by a third party. The current iteration was originally produced by <a href="http://www.ignition72.com" target="_blank">Ignition72</a> on contract, and the work featured here is a combination of their code and mine. Some of my contributions included:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="vaci-v3-1/index.html" target="_blank">Redesigned home page</a></li>
			<li><a href="vaci-v3-1/about.html?open=Robinson" target="_blank">Added support for hyperlinking to specific staff bios (this example links to mine)</a></li>
			<li><a href="vaci-v3-0/innovation-profiles.html" target="_blank">Redesigned innovation profiles</a></li>
			<li><a href="vaci-v3-0/blog/2013-12-19-newmark-bearing-witness.html" target="_blank">Created new blog with filterable menu</a></li>
			<li><a href="vaci-v3-1/program-d2d.html" target="_blank">Designed resources page to emulate a folder tree</a></li>

		<h2><a href="va-github/index.html" target="_blank">VA GitHub Page</a></h2>
		<p>As a side project while with the Center for Innovation, I designed and developed a GitHub landing page for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The page is a gateway to all of VA's open source repositories on GitHub. I followed some stylistic guidance pertaining to the layout and color scheme, but otherwise the design is mine.</p>

		<p>I designed and developed a static website for my fantasy hockey league, which I continue to maintain. The site showcases a few of my ventures into graphic design. In addition to the header collage, I <a href="javascript:viewLogos();">designed logos</a> for several teams in my leagues.</p>
